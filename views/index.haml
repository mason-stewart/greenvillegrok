            .span5
              %h4 Grok is 100% free.
              %p And always will be. It's core belief that helps keep this conference small and real. We won't grow into a behemoth conference; it would kill the awesome.

                %p We'll be letting 100 people into Greenville Grok. We want to keep things small and true. Also, Grok is repeatable. You have no excuse for not doing your own Grok, and if you ask nicely we'll even help you do it.

                %h4 Who is doing this thing?
                %p Grok is the outcome of a groggy beer dream of <a href="http://twitter.com/whale">Matthew Smith</a>. After too much time and money spent at SXSW in 2010 he decided to force people to come to him. Lazy sod. It worked, and now that it's in its second year, it's now a <a href="http://coworkgreenville.com">CoWork</a> led gig. We also got some help from some <a href="http://twitter.com/blankenship">amazing</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chandlervdw">friends</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/fictivecameron">who</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/shiflett">love</a> us with their talents and their good looks.
